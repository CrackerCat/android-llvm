# DEMO LLVM:
A toy app for testing the LLVM backend.

This should have been something like [art/test](../test) but this
probably requires host support (x86 linux/darwin) for the LLVM backend as well.

# Install:
`./install.sh`
This will execute the gradle scripts to compile and sign the app.
You will need to generate a `signKey`.
